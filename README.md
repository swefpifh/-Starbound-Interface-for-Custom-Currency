Contents :
- 1 wallet as an activatable object : `"/spawnitem myWallet"`
- 2 example currencies : `"/spawnitem mymoney01"`, `"/spawnitem mymoney02"`
- 2 recipes to delete the currencies invoked in admin mode. (Basic craft button on the right side of the screen)
- Readable files to facilitate the customization of your interface and the integration of your currency.
